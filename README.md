# simpleOutlookAddIn
This is just about the simplest VSTO Add-In possible. I am just putting it here as a means to send it to MS support in a problem report.

This solution was created in Visual Studio 2010. Apologies for not using 2015. The lack of a well-functioning installation project template in 2015 forced my decision. In a VS 2015 debug environment, a similar plugin developed against Office 2013 behaves in exactly the same fashion, as I would expect.
